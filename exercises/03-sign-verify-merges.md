Signing merges from one branch into another is achieved via the [`--verify-signatures` flag][git-merge-verifysignatures] to `git merge`, which is important to understand how it works:

> Verify that the tip commit of the side branch being merged is signed with a valid key, i.e. a key that has a valid uid: in the default trust model, this means the signing key has been signed by a trusted key. If the tip commit of the side branch is not signed with a valid key, the merge is aborted.

This means that Git will only check that the tip or last commit of the branches are signed, not every commit.

## Outcomes

> In this exercise, the process for signing and verifying merges is covered including:
>
> 1. Explicitly sign and verify commits
> 1. Troubleshooting problems
> 1. Optional Git configurations to sign and verify all commits

## Steps

> **Note**
> This exercise uses preparation done previously in "[Signing and verifying commits](02-sign-verify-commits.md)".

1. **Create a branch where changes will be committed towards v1.0.0 release**

   ```shell
   git checkout -b feature/v1.0.0
   ```

1. **Create a simple "Hello world!" shell script**

   ```shell
   cat << 'EOF' > hello-world.sh
   #! /usr/bin/env bash

   echo "Hello world!"
   EOF

   chmod 755 hello-world.sh
   ./hello-world.sh
   ```

   resulting in:

   ```
   Hello world!
   ```

1. **Commit "Hello world!" shell script to feature branch**

   ```shell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Adding hello-world script for v1.0.0 release"
   ```

   <img alt="Git tree after commiting hello-world script on feature/v1.0.0 branch" src="assets/03-post-commit.png" width="600" height="394" />

1. **Checkout the default branch to prepare for merging the feature branch**

   ```shell
   git checkout main
   ```

1. **Update the README prior to merging our changes for the new script**

   ```shell
   cat << 'EOF' >> README.md

   ## Hello world!

   The `v1.0.0` release contains the `hello-world.sh` script, which understandably displays `Hello world!`.
   EOF
   ```

1. **Commit updated README changes prior to merging our changes**

   ```shell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Expanding README for upcoming feature"
   ```

   <img alt="Git tree after updating README before merge" src="assets/03-pre-merge.png" width="600" height="394" />

1. **Merge the feature branch, ensuring signatures are verified**

   ```shell
   git merge --verify-signatures feature/v1.0.0 -m "Merging in work towards v1.0.0 release"
   ```

   <img alt="Git tree after merging feature/v1.0.0 branch" src="assets/03-post-merge.png" width="600" height="394" />

   Possible results:

   - ```
     Commit 666e636 has a good GPG signature by andyfeller@github.com
     Merge made by the 'ort' strategy.
      hello-world.sh | 3 +++
      1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
      create mode 100755 hello-world.sh
     ```

     :partying_face: Congratulations!  SSH merge signing is good.

   - ```
     fatal: Commit 666e636 does not have a GPG signature.
     ```

     :disappointed_relieved: Do not to worry!  This is error is likely due to the last commit not being signed or not trusted signer.

   For more information about signing merges, see "[`git merge --verify-signatures`][git-merge-verifysignatures]".

1. **Confirm logs show SSH commit sign status**

   ```shell
   git log
   ```

   Possible results:

   - ```

     ```

     :partying_face: Congratulations!  SSH merge verification setup is good.

1. **Configure additional SSH merge signing and verifying for workshop repository specifically:**

   ```shell
   git config merge.verifySignatures true
   ```

   > **Note**
   > To globally configure SSH signing and verifying, use the `--global` flag:
   >
   > ```shell
   > git config --global merge.verifySignatures true
   > ```

   For more information about these Git configuration options, see [`merge.verifySignatures`][git-merge-verifysignatures].
