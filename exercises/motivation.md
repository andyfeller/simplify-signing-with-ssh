It is has never been more critical to secure our supply chain as sophisticated breaches occur.  In the May 2021 White House "[Executive Order on Improving the Nationâ€™s Cybersecurity][whitehouse-improving-nations-cybersecurity]" executive order, enhancing software supply chain had a whole section devoted to establishing trust:

- `4.e.iii`

  > employing automated tools, or comparable processes, to maintain trusted source code supply chains, thereby ensuring the integrity of the code;

- `4.e.vi`

  > maintaining accurate and up-to-date data, provenance (i.e., origin) of software code or components, and controls on internal and third-party software components, tools, and services present in software development processes, and performing audits and enforcement of these controls on a recurring basis;

- `4.e.x`

  > ensuring and attesting, to the extent practicable, to the integrity and provenance of open source software used within any portion of a product.
